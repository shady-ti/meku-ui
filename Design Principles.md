# The Zen of Mēku

## Involved

Mēku never gets between me and what I am crafting.

```
There is no me, no world, no leisure, no work,
no within, no without . . . there is only the crafting.
```

<br/><br/><br/>

## Obvious

When Mēku shows me something, I know what it does without having to guess.

```
There is one — and ideally only one — obvious meaning to all things.
In the face of ambiguous meaning, there is still no need to guess.
```

<br/><br/><br/>

## Attention Deflecting

Mēku never seeks more attention or interaction from me.  My mind is enraptured
completely by my work.

```
Simple is better than complex, complex is better than complicated,
empty is better than full — there exists no UI.
```

<br/><br/><br/>

## Understanding

Mēku knows what I want to do, I never need to stop and navigate to get to where I
want.

```
Flat is better than nested — the unnecessary intermediaries have been deleted.
The destination is one. The paths are many, yet meandering paths do not exist.
```
