# Design Component Name

## In Context

<!-- Outline How Mēku's design principles inspire the design of this design component. These
aren't specifics, these are the broad ideas that guide the specifics. -->

### Involved

<!-- There is no me, no world, no leisure, no work,
no within, no without . . . there is only the crafting. -->

<br/><br/>

### Obvious

<!-- There is one — and ideally only one — obvious meaning to all things.
In the face of ambiguous meaning, there is still no need to guess. -->

<br/><br/>

### Attention Deflecting

<!-- Simple is better than complex, complex is better than complicated,
plain is better than cluttered — there exists no UI. -->

<br/><br/>

### Understanding

<!-- Flat is better than nested — the unnecessary intermediaries have been deleted.
The destination is one. The paths are many, yet meandering paths do not exist. -->
